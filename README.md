# Instagram-Follower-Tracker
A selenium automation that calculates like count and stats of your  Instagram followers.


_With this automation you can distinguish your most-interacted and ghost followers.The automation will provie a text file that shows like counts of your whole followers in order._

**As it will be mentioned later , you need to use my other project, [Instagram-Followers](https://github.com/dorukarslan/Instagram-Followers) to obtain intended text file.**




**In order to use this automation you need to fill some parts in the code block with your Instagram infos.**

First things first you shoud tell path of gecko driver to browser(where 'gecko drivers path here ' is written).

Then you need to write your login information to log and pas variables(Likewise, where 'un here' and 'pw here 'is written).


**Lastly, in order to get the result you should have a text file that contains your whole followers 
so, you can use my other project [Instagram-Followers](https://github.com/dorukarslan/Instagram-Followers) to obtain it. After getting the text file from project, you need to write path of it to Followers variable(where 'Followers text file's path here' is written) **

If all of the requierments are satisfied, you are ready to run the code.Enjoy!



**ATTENTION !!**

_Depending on your internet connection errors may occur, if it will, you can increase time of sleep to prevent it.Likewise,since my internet connection was poor, I decided sleep times with trial and error process.Therefore, it takes a little bit long to complete. You can increase or decrease them but I don't recommend it without trying this version once or twice._
